# RAG-Speech-to-Image

**Speech-to-Image Generator Model**

**Project Overview**

This project implements a Speech-to-Image Generator that transforms audio input into meaningful images. The application integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision (CV) to process user-provided speech, generate text interpretations, and convert them into images. The model is built using CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines to enhance multimodal understanding.

**The project follows a structured approach:**

Speech Processing: Converts speech input into text.
Text Processing: Processes and enhances the extracted text.
Image Retrieval & Generation: Uses CLIP and RAG models to find relevant images or generate new ones based on text.
Search & Retrieval: Implements efficient indexing and searching using FAISS and Hugging Face datasets.

**How to Run the Project**
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Bealux007/Speech-to-Image-Generator_Model.git
cd Speech-to-Image-Generator_Model
**2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
**3. Install Dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt
**4. Run the Application**
streamlit run app.py
This will start the Streamlit interface where you can provide audio input, process it into text, and generate images based on the extracted meaning.

**Project Workflow**
**Step 1: Speech Processing**
The system takes an audio input from the user.
Converts speech into text using a speech-to-text model.
Preprocesses the text for better representation.
**Step 2: Text-to-Image Generation**
The CLIP model processes text input and finds the closest matching image.
If no relevant image is found, the RAG pipeline retrieves additional data to refine the results.
**Step 3: Image Retrieval & Search**
FAISS indexing enables fast similarity search.
The system finds the best-matching images based on semantic meaning.
**Step 4: Job Search Feature (Optional)**
If used for job matching, the job_search.py script:
Fetches job descriptions from Hugging Face datasets.
Converts job descriptions into embeddings.
Matches job queries based on skills, experience, and location.
